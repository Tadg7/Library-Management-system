# Library-Management-system

## Introduction

Welcome to the Library Management System project! This Java-based application is designed to streamline and automate the management of libraries.
It offers a comprehensive solution for handling various library operations, making it easier for librarians and users to manage books, members,
and transactions efficiently.

The Library Management System provides a user-friendly interface for both librarians and members, enabling seamless interaction with the system.
Librarians can perform tasks such as adding new books, registering members, and tracking borrowed books. Members can search for books, check availability,
and view their borrowing history.

## Features

Book Management: Easily add and remove books from the library catalog.
Member Management: Register new members, update member information, and manage member records.
Transaction Management: Track book borrowings and returns, with due date notifications.
Search Functionality: Efficiently search for books by title, author, genre, or ISBN.
User Authentication: Secure login for both librarians and members to ensure data integrity and privacy.
This project is a practical implementation of fundamental programming concepts, including object-oriented design, data structures, file handling,
and user interface design. It serves as an excellent tool for learning and understanding the intricacies of building a robust and scalable software system.
